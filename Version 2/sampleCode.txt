This code serves as a sample of how our arm might operate.
This is pseudocode similar to the structure of an ino file.
We're hoping to control the arm with this code via an Arduino 
or a similar device.

This is where the variables for our EMG, button, and servos 
will go. Our current idea incorporates 5 servos, 1 to 2 EMGs,
and at least 1 button. We're going to use macros to give the user
different options with their hand. These will be manually toggled
with the button. Each macro will have an associated function.

The code will execute in the following way:

> Once the user inserts the battery, the script begins.
> Each servo will be initilized, and then output/input 
  pins for each device (ex. servos, EMGs, buttons, etc) will be set.
> Additional variables will be created to track the selected macro,
  the position of each finger, the value of the EMG(s), and
  the specified EMG thresholds needed to trigger a servo.
> The setup() function will assign each servo its output pin
  and default position.
> The loop() function will first determine if our macro button
  has been pressed and released. If so, it will switch the selected 
  macro.
> The loop() function will then
